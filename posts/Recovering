I nearly didn't write something for today because dedication to a daily task is difficult, especially when said task is running and you fuck your feet up the point at which walking becomes a careful balance of oscillating the expletives "fuck" and "ow." Point and case, I'm on the border of leaving this at just that prior sentence. Trust me, I really am, but by this point I'm already far enough along to just continue writing because the fact of the matter is I really don't have anything better to do right this second than to not write this.

I didn't have as much opportunity for this today like I did during the last two hiatus ridden days and that’s mostly to blame for this shorter entry. I used today to catch my body up on existing on a more level plane that doesn’t include falling over and dying in a ditch because, you see, sometimes I think I do have <i>some</i> reasonable priorities, like napping after a long less than 4-hour span of time.
