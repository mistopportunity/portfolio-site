I guess, since I'll be dropping two solid hours of my life into this proverbial abyss every day for 5 days over 10 weeks and it has only been the first hour of that - and the only thing I've accomplished thus far is crying, developing a slouch, and asking myself why God may hate me and gives me no pretty friends - I suppose that perhaps I will join the Facebook mommy warriors, the fruit juicers, the millennials, and sardonic authors alike in this thing called writing in the 21st century.
<br><br>
As for my first entry, I hereby present a solid fact about my present state in life: Holy hell, my feet hurt. Apparently the best thing for this "holy Hell my feet hurt" condition is not to use them. But gee if the solution to life's problems was just following the solutions that we're given and not being fucked over by preexisting responsibilities and necessities, I'm not even sure that the world would turn. It seems we must regularly be uppercut by the elemental forces of nature when we least expect it as if being flipped the bird by the universe controls all, from the birds singing, clocks ticking, kids who dream and work so intently towards their career aspirations succumbing to the fate of janitorial duties, to babies dropping into a life they didn't ask to be a part of. There's simply no other explanation: Everyone gets screwed.
<br><br>
As if getting screwed plain and simple even with this foreknowledge is not bad enough, you'll also get screwed in the context of getting screwed because you won't even know where and when to defend yourself, but not all is lost: The very nature of unpredictability itself does exhibit some predictability; you can certainly expect the unexpected. Though, you'll still be raped by what the great beyond has in store for you, and you won't know how nor when. So must we be on guard at all times? In a sense, yes. But will it help? Probably not. All we can do is attempt to correctly surmise as to why. But I digress, the key takeaway here is that regardless of the revolution of the pendulum, that may or may not have already hit you in the face 17 dozen times, it's coming for you. Just accept it. It's the way of the wind. Like your father, your father's father, and your father's father's fatherd before him, they all went through it too. Next, it'll be your turn to pass the torch. You can call it getting screwed or you can call it the circle of life. These terms just so happen to be synonymous.
<br><br>
"Okay okay, that's a nice little speech that'll jumpstart my journey along the path of my impending nihilism, but why do your feet hurt?" Good question. Well. You see. I like running. A lot of people do. You get to, well, break your feet. In addition to that, you get to humble brag about your accomplishments on Facebook and blogs of the internet - . . . There's probably more benefits but I really can't preach for anything more than the spiritually enlighting experience that I've been so graciously given of dually bricking my feet so that I can dilapidatedly strut myself around the world for all to see like I'm a drunk girl in high-heels.
<br><br>
Don't get me wrong though, I love runing! However, I can't in good conscience endorse it if you have any of the following afflictions that a lot of runners curiously already have: A) asthma, B) no legs, C) lingering emotional damage from an abusive childhood, D) demons, or E) an ex-wife. For the latter situations, I've heard that some combinations of eating-disorders, alcohol, and therapy can be of better help than running, but really, we are a mostly just a product of all the things that traumatize us anyways.
<br><br>
So, what exactly was my short but untimely fall from grace? Well, like cocaine, all in moderation my dear friends.
