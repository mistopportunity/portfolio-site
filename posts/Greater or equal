(big fucking surprise)<br><br>
One week down. I'm not sure how many are left. That's what I keep telling others, including those   like my own mother who didn't know I had started at all, and my father who didn't even realize it had only been a week. Anyways, that's what I'll continue to tell myself too for as long as I possibly can. I'm just going to count up. 1... 2... 3... Yes, those are numbers. Yes, you already know those ones.  No, I don't care. I actually get to sleep as much as I want tonight so I really really couldn't care less. "Do you have any plans for the weekend?" a fellow student asked me. "Sleep," I replied. She laughed. Then I left and the rest is history.

Also yes I fucking know this entry is not up to par in length nor quality with the previous entries. Give me time. Besides, I can't make a perfect entry every time. If I did, there would be no balance nor contrast between the subpar and mediocre; there's got to be points that go lower than the already established baseline so that some of these can still seem good.
