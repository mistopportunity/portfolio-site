For a building reserved to scientific studies, the engineering atrocities committed here by the wheels of these chairs should be punishable by death. The wheels are too small to effectively roll the chairs at all, especially coupled with the weight of its possibly overweight person and the chair itself. Chair designers, ever fucking heard of ballbearings? And the chairs are so tall anyways that if you push from the back of chair where you actually sit, you're going to push it over in a manner akin to what happened to the Challenger. Hell, even if you try to push yourself away from the table, you're going to push the table over before making a lateral chair success.

You know actually, maybe I should be applauding these engineers for making such sturdy chairs because they don't fucking move. Well done. See? Found that silver lining.
<br><br>
So, all in all, unless you personally pick up the chair to reposition it to your desired destination or you possess the divine power to break the laws of friction, maybe someone should've realized not to put these chairs in a carpeted room and these chairs suck dick.

It turns out the chairs didn't have wheels at all.
