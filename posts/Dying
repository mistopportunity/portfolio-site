It's so hard convincing yourself that the thing that you desire the most is a lie. Or is it a lie? See. See what I mean? It's no secret that knowing what you want is important in leading a fulfilling life - a lot of unprevailing people don't know - but perhaps of greater importance is knowing why it is that we desire these certain things because it's so much easier to live without getting what you want in life than it is to live a lie.
<br><br>
And I don't know. I've worn the question of doubt down so thin that I'm not even sure what I want most of all anymore. Besides that, should there even be a most wanted desire? What happens to the back burners when dish A goes to shit? I don't want to be alone but yet here I am finding that the very desire leads me farther to it.
<br><br>
More than any other desire, I want to have a fulfilling life. But what fulfills me? Does throwing myself at people and being over-trusting fulfill me? Does happiness fulfill me? Or is Mexican food and British sci-fi television what really fulfills me? There's so many questions that I can ask myself or even scream to the mountains that I'll simply never receive answers to. So, fuck it. Take your indefinite answers and shove it up your ass, world.
<br><br>
All I know is, when things lose their value, or when value can be so entirely dismissed by its shitty toxic history (for example, the currency of the European Union), it is so hard to get that value back. It's as if nothing - from your own personal rain cloud hailing cinder bricks on you, to unicorns ejaculating rainbows - nothing quite pays the bills when you're paying with Euros.
<br><br>
But like all my bittersweet and often maniacally induced episodes of writing these epistles, there's a silver lining. You don't have to give up on your desires, you do only live once. You just shouldn't live in fear of self-humility and failure unless (God forbid) that's your kink.

Now for some whiny insequential bullshit:<br>
What I was attached to was simple and comforting and welcoming. I thought I belonged. All the signs were right. I could have walked with that forever. But all this, whatever all this is, it's complicated and messy and I can't even keep my ideas nor place guilt upon myself consistently. I lost a lot and now everything is a lot. It's grating, grinding, gnashing. Even the strongest forms of contempt weren't enough for me to let go because I don't think I can hold on again.

Ignore the fact of what God forsaken hour I was previously awake to, being awake at this hour is a punishment against myself for a crime so severe I surely couldn't have committed it. I am just going to take Spanish 3 online instead. I already had qualms over this class so I'm opting for not killing myself on only the second day in. Who cares that today I'll have to go through the unknown yet presumably painful process of transferring classes.

The deeds have been completed. I also have more caffeine and energy in my bloodstream. So, so far today, I've been raped and gouged to varying tangents, reconfronted a lady who I heard utter "motherfucking bitch" under her breath after I had just recently asked her a question, oh and did I get to raped, gouged, and prodded yet? Yes. That too.
<br><br>
I had to purchase a packet of math worksheets, a now verifiable source in writing of my impending PTSD. I really cannot overstate the volume of this crime against the forests. The Lorax will probably be showing up at my door soon to rape me in the ass but honestly I don't think I deserve anything less.

In other news, I'm apparently not even good enough to be told when I'm being excommunicated. Is wanting to at least be told that I'm an unrelenting asshole and to fuck off forever beyond my severance?

Four hours remain today for being a happy college student while I literally try through a careful combination of breathing and holding my hands to my face to prevent the oncoming doom I sense of vomiting everywhere. I also hear I will also be handling termites in a couple of hours. This is a really good combo I think. I really can't wait to see what fate could still possibly have in store for me in this day that should be closer to its end than it really is. Remember my "life is unexpected and will fuck you" speech? Goodness gracious, I couldn't have asked for a more hallmark example of getting fucked unexpectedly. Also, there's now a thing stuck on my eye. I can't see it at least but I still think the world is trying to kill me prematurely. But as it bears repetition to say, there is always a silver lining if you look for one: The world won't kill me before at least 10 AM now, unless of course by my own missteps.
